# Plotly_Deploy
Interactive Data Visualization

# About this project

Purpose: Build an interactive data visualization for the web.

For this project, I utilized Javascript's Plotly library to build three basic plots (horizontal bar chart, gauge chart, and bubble chart). I applied D3.json to retrieve external data, and then used Javascript functional programming to manipulate that data. I implemented event handlers to add interactivity to this data visualization. The charts are created once an end user selects a sample ID number from the drop-down menu options. Finally, I launched these interactive charts through GitHub Pages.
